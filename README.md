CampusLoop is a web-based marketplace tailored for college students to buy, sell, and trade furniture, clothing, and dorm essentialsâ€”especially during move-out and graduation seasons. The platform is designed to streamline peer-to-peer exchanges within college communities, reducing waste and helping students save money.

## Features

- Verified student-only access via .edu email authentication
- Listings for furniture, clothing, electronics, and more
- Campus-specific filtering and local delivery options
- Direct messaging and in-app negotiation tools
- Seamless experience for students moving out or graduating
- Environmentally friendly alternative to bulk waste disposal

## Why CampusLoop

College students often leave behind usable furniture, clothes, and supplies due to time constraints, lack of storage, or logistics. Facebook groups and generic platforms are fragmented and inefficient. CampusLoop centralizes and optimizes this exchange, helping students:

- Save money furnishing dorms or apartments
- Offload unwanted items before moving
- Build sustainable habits through reuse
- Engage with their campus community
